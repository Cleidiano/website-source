        We would like to thank the above sponsors for their support of the Ebean project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sponsorship is important for open source projects in that it enables the maintainers to better
        maintain the project with documentation, examples, bug fixes, enhancements and supporting
        users. To make a great library takes a lot of time and effort and our sponsors
        recognise this.
      </p>
      <p>
        This funding directly contributes to the effort to make Ebean awesome.
      </p>

      <h2>Sponsorship</h2>
      <p>
        These companies are sponsoring Ebean at:
      </p>
      <h5 class="plm">Euros</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>600 Euros per year or</li>
        <li>50 Euros per month</li>
      </ul>
      <h5 class="plm">USD</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>675 USD per year or</li>
        <li>56 USD per month</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For less that $2/day these companies help foster the development of the best ORM on the JVM
        and in turn get great visibility to some of the best developers in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that to date all sponsors have preferred a single annual sponsorship. This is
        likely to be simpler for the accounting team and for management sign off.
        If you would like to sponsor at a different rate get in touch and discuss but the
        preference is for all sponsors to sponsor the same amount.
      </p>

      <h2 id="become">Becoming a sponsor</h2>
      <p>
        If your company team would like to become a sponsor for Ebean then:
      </p>
      <h5>1. Get in touch</h5>
      <p>
        Send an email to robin.bygrave<i>@</i>gmail.com letting me know that you are keen
        to become a sponsor of the Ebean project. Let me know your preferred currency and
        if that isn't Euros or USD the expected exchange rate.
      </p>
      <h5>2. Invoice</h5>
      <p>
        I'll send you back an invoice for a year of sponsorship. Your accounting team will
        want this.
      </p>
      <h5>3. Payment</h5>
      <p>
        You can pay via PayPal / Credit card or pay direct. Sponsors to date have
        preferred to pay a single annual amount rather than a recurring montly payment as
        this means there is only then a single payment for the accounting team to process.
      </p>
      <h5>4. Website update</h5>
      <p>
        I'll update the website and github pages with your corporate logo and url.
        Your company will get increased visibility to the development community with page
        impressions from both the ebean.io website and github project page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good things happen.
      </p>

        <h3>Full time sponsorship</h3>
        <p>
          <i>Big thanks to Sean and Accolade from all the Ebean fans!!</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="//accolade.com">Accolade.com</a> hired the main contributor to Ebean (Rob Bygrave)
          full time for a year to develop many of the features in Ebean we now all enjoy.
          The ability to work full time on Ebean really helped push the Ebean project to
          another level that would otherwise have taken much longer to achieve.
        </p>
        <p>
          The development of <a href="/docs/query/query-beans">Query beans</a> also started
          with the prompting of Evan at Accolade so an additional hat tip to Evan for that!!
        </p>
        <p>
          A massive amount of work was done included the development of the following features:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/docs/features/history">History support</a></li>
          <li><a href="/docs/setup/dbmigration">DB Migration</a></li>
          <li><a href="/docs/features/elasticsearch">ElasticSearch integration</a></li>
          <li><a href="/docs/features/changelog">Changelog</a></li>
          <li><a href="/docs/features/readauditing">Read auditing</a></li>
          <li><a href="/docs/features/draftable">Draftable</a></li>
          <li><a href="/docs/features/json-in-db">JSON in the Database</a></li>
          <li><a href="/docs/features/softdelete">Soft delete</a></li>
        </ul>

<p>
  With <code>findNative</code> we supply the SQL.  The SQL can contain positioned parameters with <code>?</code>
  or named parameters like <code>:foo</code>
</p>
<p>
  With <em>findNative</em> the columns are automatically mapped to bean properties.
</p>
```java
    String sql = "select id, name from customer where name like ?";

    Customer customer = DB.findNative(Customer.class, sql)
        .setParameter(1, "Jo%")
        .findOne();
```
<p>
  An example using named parameters.
</p>
```java
  String sql = "select id, name from customer where name like :name order by name desc";

  List<|Customer> customers = DB.findNative(Customer.class, sql)
      .setParameter("name", "Jo%")
      .findList();
```
<p>
  With the above examples we are selecting <b>some</b> columns and as a result getting
  <b>partially populated entity beans</b> (which is good - we should only fetch things out of the DB
  that we need).
</p>
<p>
  We can use <code>select *</code> if we desire all the columns.
</p>
```java

  String sql = "select * from customer where name like :name order by name desc";

  List<|Customer> customers = DB.findNative(Customer.class, sql)
      .setParameter("name", "Jo%")
      .findList();
```
<h5>Internal workings</h5>
<p>
  The way this works is that when a query is first run the JDBC meta data is read for the
  columns in the resultSet and then these columns are automatically mapped to bean properties.
</p>
<p>
  This only needs to be done for the first execution of the query. How the query is mapped to
  beans is cached so we only need to read the JDBC resultSet meta data once per query.
</p>

<h3>Limitations</h3>

<p>
  The limitation with using findNative (excluding Oracle) is that it can only map multiple tables when the path
  for a given table is <em>unique</em>.
</p>
<p>
  For example, lets say we have Customer that maps both a billingAddress and shippingAddress
  to the Address. When ebean tries to map a column for the address table it does not know
  which path (billingAddress or shippingAddress) the column maps to.
</p>
<p>
  When we hit this limitation we need to use <a href="/docs/query/rawSql">RawSql</a> instead
  where we can map the columns more explicitly to bean paths/properties.
</p>

<h4>Multiple tables</h4>
<p>
  Excluding Oracle (see oracle limitation below) our SQL can select from multiple tables and these
  can automatically be mapped.
</p>
<p>
  For example, we can fetch and populate 2 related beans like Customer and Contact.
</p>
```java
  // Contacts + Customer
  String sql
    = "select con.id, con.first_name, con.last_name, cust.id, cust.name " +
     " from contact con " +
     " join customer cust on cust.id = con.customer_id " +
     " order by con.first_name desc";

  List<|Contact> contacts =

    nativeSql(sql)
      .findList();
```

<h5>Oracle limitation</h5>
<p>
  There is a limitation with the Oracle JDBC driver in that the meta data currently does not include
  the table that a column relates to. This means that with Oracle we can only map a single table
  and not multiple tables (and would have to use <a href="/docs/query/rawSql">RawSql</a> instead).
</p>


<h3 id="rawSql">RawSql</h3>
<p>
  Using findNative is preferred over <em>RawSql</em> as the way to execute <code>SQL</code> queries with
  <code>entity beans</code> because it is nice and simple as the columns are mapped to properties
  automatically for us.
</p>
<p>
  However, findNative has some limitations when we want the select clause to include columns from
  multiple tables (limitations described above).  When we hit those limitations we then need to
  use <a href="/docs/query/rawSql">RawSql</a> with more explicit mapping of columns to properties.

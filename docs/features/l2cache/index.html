  <h2 id="overview">L2 Cache</h2>
  <p>
    When we want to talk about caching for performance we are talking about the "Level 2"
    cache or the "server cache". It is called the "Level 2 cache" because the persistence
    context is often referred to as the "Level 1 cache".
  </p>
  <p>
    The goal of the L2 server cache is to gain very significant performance improvement by
    not having to hit the database. Ebean has 2 types of caches – Bean caches and Query caches.
  </p>

  <h4>Bean Caches</h4>
  <p>
    Bean caches hold entity beans and are keyed by their Id values. The bean cache can be used with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Find by id</li>
    <li>Find one by "natural key"</li>
    <li>Find many by "natural keys"</li>

  </ul>

  <h4>Query Caches</h4>
  <p>
    Query caches hold the results of queries (Lists, Sets, Maps of entity beans and Count) and are keyed
    by the query hash value (effectively a hash of the query and its bind values).
    The entries in a query cache are invalidated by ANY change to the underlying table –
    insert, update or delete. This means that the query cache is only useful on entities that are
    infrequently modified (typically "lookup tables" such as countries, currencies, status codes
    etc).
  </p>
  <p>
    The query cache can be used with:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Find list/set/map queries</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="l2-l3">L2/local and L3/remote</h2>
  <p>
    L2 cache can thought of as having <code>Near Caches</code> and <code>Remote Caches</code> where
    a "Near cache" is in the same process as the Ebean instance (and does not require a network
    access) and a "Remote cache" that requires a network access.
  </p>

  <h4>L3 bean cache options</h4>
  <p>
    The following are the 3 main approaches when we get a miss on the a local L2 bean cache.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use nothing and hit the database</li>
    <li>Use <a href="https://hazelcast.com/">Hazelcast</a>, <a href="https://ignite.apache.org/">Apache Ignite</a> or similar data grid/key value store</li>
    <li>Use <a href="">ElasticSearch</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The L2 bean cache is keyed by id value so really anything resembling a key value store (distributed map)
    works well for bean caching.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that ElasticSearch has the advantage that we update it with changes (as deltas to documents) rather than
    remove/invalidate an entry in a map so with ElasticSearch we are always going to get a hit (and hence always
    avoid hitting the database). There is also the potential benefit that ElasticSearch documents will often contain
    denormalisation (embedded documents) so a hit against ElasticSearch will populate more of the graph and avoid
    extra hits.  For example, a hit of an order can populate customer details like customer name.
  </p>

  <h4>L3 query cache options</h4>
  <p>
    The following are the 2 main approaches when we get a miss on the local L2 query cache.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use nothing and hit the database</li>
    <li>Use <a href="">ElasticSearch</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The significant benefit of using <code>ElasticSearch</code> is that it can address both parts of the L2 cache
    meaning that we can use it for <code>L2 query cache</code> (by translating ORM queries into ElasticSearch queries)
    as well as the <code>L2 bean cache</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can update ElasticSearch as changes occur and use the performance of inverted indexes to perform very fast
    queries (avoiding the database hit like L2 query cache but not having the issue of frequent invalidation that
    L2 query cache suffers from).
  </p>

  <h4>ElasticSearch</h4>
  <p>
    The current emphasis for Ebean ORM is to utilise ElasticSearch as the best L3 cache option.
    This means that
  </p>

  <h2 id="read-consistency">Read consistency</h2>
  <blockquote>
    With Ebean L2 caching there is no attempt to provide transactional read consistency
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    ACID/Transactional databases do a lot of things for us and this includes providing "read consistency"
    based on transaction isolation levels (MVCC databases like Postgres and Oracle emphasis this more).
  </p>
  <p>
    With Ebean L2 caching there is <code>no attempt to provide transactional read consistency</code>.
    What that means is that if part of your application needs transactional read consistency then
    <code>use the database</code> to do that.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    L2 cache works to eventual consistency
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    Instead with Ebean L2 caching the view is that eventual consistency is good enough, much simpler
    and a more natural approach when using ElasticSearch.  Given what ElasticSearch is doing for us
    behind the scenes (flush, merge, optimise etc) in order to provide inverted index awesomeness
    we happily go with eventual consistency and the associated simplicity.
  </p>

  <h5>Near cache</h5>
  <p>
    With Ebean the view is that the cost of trying to make L2 caching read consistent is not worth it.
    Instead we treat the L2 cache as <code>reasonably up to date</code>. In practical terms this means that
    cache invalidation occurs in the background after successful commits. L2 near caches are invalidated across
    the cluster very quickly (millisecond) but this is not strictly transactional (there is a delay after the commit).
  </p>

  <h5>ElasticSearch</h5>
  <p>
    When we use ElasticSearch the delay of a change (insert, update, delete) being visible in ElasticSearch
    is going to be longer with a default of <code>1 second delay</code> but for various bean types
    and use cases we may choose to increase that delay to support more throughput or be more efficient overall.
    This is similar to decisions on how frequently <code>database materialised views</code> should be updated.
  </p>

  <h2 id="table-iud-invalidation">Table IUD invalidation (Bulk updates)</h2>
  <p>
    Bulk insert, update or delete events are processed by table. For a given table the bean types
    that depend on that table are determined and then for each bean type the L2 bean cache and L2 query cache
    are invalidated as necessary.
  </p>
  <h4>Cluster message</h4>
  <p>
    The message sent around the cluster contains the table name and boolean flags for insert, update and delete.
  </p>
  <h4>L2 query cache</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><code>Inserts, updates or deletes:</code> Invalidate the entire L2 query cache for the related bean type</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For any bulk statements (bulk table insert, update or delete statement) the entire L2 query cache is invalidated
    for the associated bean type.
    For example, a bulk update of the customer table invalidates the entire L2 query cache for the Customer bean type.
  </p>
  <h4>L2 bean cache</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><code>Inserts:</code> Do not effect the L2 bean cache</li>
    <li><code>Updates:</code> Invalidate the entire L2 bean cache for the related bean type</li>
    <li><code>Deletes:</code> Invalidate the entire L2 bean cache for the related bean type</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="bean-iud-invalidation">Bean IUD invalidation</h2>
  <p>
    Persisted beans are processed by bean type and id value.
  </p>
  <h4>Cluster message</h4>
  <p>
    The message sent around the cluster contains the bean type and 3 lists of ids - a list of id values for inserted, updated and deleted beans.
  </p>

  <h4>L2 query cache</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><code>Inserts, updates or deletes:</code> Invalidate the entire L2 query cache for the bean type</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For any bean persist event invalidates the entire related L2 query cache for the associated bean type.
    For example, saving a customer bean invalidates the entire L2 query cache for the Customer bean type.
  </p>

  <h4>L2 bean cache</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><code>Inserts:</code> Do not effect the L2 bean cache</li>
    <li><code>Updates:</code> An entry is updated with changes</li>
    <li><code>Deletes:</code> An entry is removed from the L2 bean cache based on the id value</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="external-invalidation">External invalidation</h2>

  <p>
    When you save/delete beans via Ebean.save() and Ebean.delete() etc Ebean will
    automatically maintain its cache (removing cached beans and cached queries as
    appropriate). However, you may often find yourself modifying the database outside of
    Ebean. (via stored procedures etc)
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, you could be using other frameworks, your own JDBC code, stored
    procedures, batch systems etc. When you do so (and you are using Ebean caching) then
    you can inform Ebean so that it invalidates appropriate parts of its cache.
  </p>

  ```java
  // inform Ebean that some rows have been inserted and updated
  // on the country table.
  // ... Ebean will invalidate the appropriate caches
  boolean inserts = true;
  boolean updates = true;
  boolean deletes = false;
  Ebean.externalModification("country", inserts, updates, deletes);
  ```

  <h5>Alternative:</h5>
  <p>
    ServerCacheManager also provides explicit API for clearing caches.
  </p>

  ```java
  // clearAll() caches via the ServerCacheManager ...
  ServerCacheManager cacheManager = database.cacheManager();

  // Clear all the caches on the default/primary EbeanServer
  cacheManager.clearAll();

  // clear both the bean and query cache
  // for Country beans ...
  cacheManager.clear(Country.class);
  ```

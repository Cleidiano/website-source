<h2>Why Ebean exists</h2>
<p>
  There are 3 parts to the JPA standard. It defines how objects are <code>Mapped</code>, <code>Persisted</code>
  and <code>Queried</code>.
</p>
<p>
  The Ebean view is that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>JPA Mapping is pretty good</li>
  <li>JPA Persisting is not so great</li>
  <li>JPA querying is not so great</li>
  <li>Hibernate is not sufficient</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ebean</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Is a session-less ORM making it easier to use and understand</li>
  <li>Provides much better control over queries / what to fetch</li>
  <li>Provides better control over persisting</li>
</ul>

<h2>JPA Query</h2>
<p>
  The view is that the JPA Query language does not have good support for controlling how much to fetch.  In terms
  of JPA they have introduced the <code>FetchGraph</code> hints which do this but there are a few downsides to this:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>FetchGraph hints are just hints and are effectively ignored by Hibernate</li>
  <li>Hibernate instead (roughly) promotes the idea of creating DTO objects and fetching into those instead</li>
  <li>FetchGraph fell out of the ugly tree - not pretty to use, not part of JPQL</li>
</ul>
<p>
  That is, the ability to fetch <code>partial objects</code> in JPA is poor and this can lead to poor
  performance fetching data from the database. We want the ability to control the this much better than what JPA provides.
</p>

<h2>JPA Persisting</h2>
<p>
  The JPA API requires that persisting beans are attached to the persistence context. This means that developers
  don't explicitly control which beans are persisted and have little control over the order in which beans are
  persisted to the database. The lack of ordering control can lead to deadlock issues. The lack of explicit control
  means that the behavior is less obvious and the interactions with bulk updates and external SQL on the JPA
  persistence context needs to be managed (explicitly detach beans etc).
</p>
<p>
  Ebean's approach is that beans are <code>explicitly persisted</code> and that persisting does not involve the
  persistence context.  This means that the developer has:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Control over exactly what is persisted</li>
  <li>Control over the ordering of statements</li>
  <li>No concerns when using bulk updates</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hibernate</h2>
<p>
  Respect to these people, it is a huge amount of work to build an ORM - but the view is that we want a better ORM.
  An ORM that is easier to understand, makes the simple stuff simple, makes the hard stuff doable and provides
  the performance and control that is needed when both fetching data and persisting it.
</p>
<p>
  With Hibernate 5 it could be we are seeing a move to better partial object support with their changes towards using
  bytecode enhancement (lazy loading on partially populated beans, dirty checking etc) - should be interesting.
</p>

<h2>Can Ebean implement JPA?</h2>
<p>
  The JPA API has the concepts of <code>attached</code> and <code>detached</code> beans - that is, it is
  fundamental to JPA that persisting beans are attached to the persistence context. This is not the case with
  Ebean - we have effectively removed the need for those concepts and instead just have <code>save() and delete()</code>.
</p>
<p>
  That is, Ebean has no EntityManager to manage and as such can been called a <code>session-less orm</code>.
  Ideally Ebean is be as close to JPA as possible with mapping and behavior - but it is a session-less API which
  is fundamentally different to JPA and we believe much easier to use.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ebean is a "session-less" ORM</li>
  <li>Unlike JPA Ebean has no EntityManager to manage</li>
  <li>Simpler to use and understand</li>
</ul>

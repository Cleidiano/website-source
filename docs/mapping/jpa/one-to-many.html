<h2 id="pair">Relationship Pair</h2>
<p>
  Most often we can think of <code>@OneToMany</code> and <code>@ManyToOne</code> as
  a pair representing 2 sides of a relationship. As such @OneToMany has the <code>"many"</code>
  side of the relationship and @ManyToOne has the <code>"one"</code> side of the relationship.
</p>

<h2 id="mappedBy">mappedBy</h2>
<p>
  The <code>mappedBy</code> attribute should be defined in most @OneToMany.
  The mappedBy attribute effectively refers to the other side of the relationship.
</p>

<h4>Example: Customer has many Contacts</h4>
```java
@Entity
public class Customer ...

  // mappedBy referring to the other side of this relationship
  @OneToMany(mappedBy="customer")
  List<Contact> contacts;
  ...
```
<p>
  On the other side of the relationship in the Contact entity bean we define the
  <code>@ManyToOne</code> property that the <code>mappedBy</code> refers to.
</p>

```java
@Entity
public class Contact ...

  // the customer property referred to by @OneToMany(mappedBy="customer")
  @ManyToOne(optional=false)
  Customer customer;
  ...
```

<h2 id="bidirectional">Bi-directional</h2>
<p>
  When we map both sides of the relationship with a <code>@OneToMany</code> and <code>@ManyToOne</code>
  pair we can describe this as a bi-directional relationship.  The relationship can be viewed, navigated
  and loaded from both directions.
</p>
<blockquote>
  There are no restrictions or limitations when we have a bi-directional relationship.
</blockquote>

<h2 id="no-OneToMany">Not mapping the @OneToMany</h2>
<p>
  The reason we might choose to not map the <code>@OneToMany</code> side of a relationship is
  <code>when the cardinality is high (say thousands)</code> and we deem that we never want to
  allow the application to navigate the relationship in that direction as doing so naively
  might load too many of objects.
</p>
<p>
  For example if a Customer had 1 million Orders and we naively navigated from that Customer to
  all their orders we could load 1 millions Order instances into memory which is generally something
  we don't want to do.  In this case we could use <code>filterMany</code> on a Customer query
  to filter the orders for each customer (e.g. orders created in the last week). Alternatively we can
  load the graph in the other direction (From Order to Customer).
</p>
<p>
  Omitting a @OneToMany effectively means we can't navigate or
  load the relationship from that direction and instead it forces the application to always
  use the other direction (to build object graphs).
</p>

<h2 id="no-ManyToOne">Not mapping the @ManyToOne</h2>
<p>
  When we do not map the @ManyToOne this adds a restriction and implies an <code>ownership relationship</code>.
</p>
<p>
  For example take the case of <code>Order</code> having many <code>OrderDetail</code>. When we don't map
  the @ManyToOne side in OrderDetail:
</p>
<h4>Order has details:</h4>
```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "orders")
public class Order ...

  // we MUST have cascade persist here for this
  // unidirectional case (no @ManyToOne)
  @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
  List<OrderDetail> details;
  ...
```

<h4>OrderDetail has no matching @ManyToOne:</h4>
```java
@Entity
public class OrderDetail ...

  // Does not have - @ManyToOne(optional = false) Order order;
```
<p>
  This effectively adds the restriction that to insert new OrderDetails we must
  cascade persist from Order to do so. That is, the @ManyToOne effectively represents
  the foreign key column that is on the underlying table for OrderDetail and to populate
  that foreign key column <code>we must use cascade persist from Order</code>.
</p>
<p>
  This also implies that the foreign key value can never change and hence we can view
  this conceptually as an <code>'ownership' relationship</code>.
  In this example each OrderDetail is 'owned' by an Order.
</p>

Personally I always map the @ManyToOne

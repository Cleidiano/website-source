<h2 id="db-migrations">DB Migrations</h2>
<p>
  DB Migrations are DDL changes that are applied typically when the application is started.
</p>
<p>
  Ebean can generate the migrations for us by performing a <code>diff</code> on the model and
  then generating database platform specific DDL for the change.
</p>
<p>
  Ebean can also run the migrations (similar to FlywayDb).  It is recommended to use Ebean's built
  in migration runner rather than <code>FlywayDb</code> or <code>LiquiBase</code>.
</p>


<h2 id="generate">Generate a Migration</h2>
<p>
  In <code>src/test/java</code> add code to generate migrations.
</p>
  ```java
package main;

import io.ebean.annotation.Platform;
import io.ebean.dbmigration.DbMigration;
import java.io.IOException;

public class GenerateDbMigration {

  /**
   * Generate the next "DB schema DIFF" migration.
   */
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {


    DbMigration dbMigration = DbMigration.create();
    dbMigration.setPlatform(Platform.POSTGRES);

    dbMigration.generateMigration();
  }
}
```
<p>
  To generate a migration we run this main method.
</p>
<p>
  We run this manually when we have completed some work and consider it ready to be released.
  Running the generation starts the EbeanServer in offline mode, performs a DIFF of the
  model and generates the migration DDL script.
</p>

<h2 id="run">Running migrations</h2>
<p>
  To get Ebean to run the DB migrations on startup set <code>ebean.migration.run</code> to true.
</p>
<h5>In application.yml</h5>
```yml
## run migrations when the EbeanServer starts
ebean:
  migration:
    run: true
```
<p>
  With <code>ebean.migration.run=true</code> then when Ebean starts it will look at the
  migrations and run any that need to be run.  The migration runner will by default create a table
  called <code>db_migration</code> that holds the meta data about the migrations that have been run
  and inserts into this table when migrations are successfully executed.

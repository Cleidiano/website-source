  <h2 id="overview">Extra DDL</h2>
  <p>
    We use <code>src/main/resources/extra-ddl.xml</code> to supply extra DDL
    for things like views and stored procedures and sometimes indexes -
    effectively any DDL that isn't generated via mapping annotations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The DDL in extra-ddl is then run as part of normal testing (run after <code>dropCreate</code>)
    and as part of DB migrations (as repeatable migrations).
  </p>
  <h3>Best practices</h3>
  <p>
    When using <code>extra-ddl.xml</code> there are a some practices
    that are good to follow:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Prefix the script names with a number (e.g. 1,2,3 ...) to effectively order the
      execution of the repeatable migrations relative to each other.
    </li>
    <li>
      Don't put all the DDL into a single large <code>ddl-script</code> entry.
      Instead group ddl into <code>ddl-script</code> entries for things that will be
      dropped and re-created together. If we want to drop and re-create something by itself
      it needs to be in it's own  <code>ddl-script</code> entry.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="views">Views</h2>
  <p>
    To define DB views which we can then use on an entity bean via <code>@View</code>
    we should add <code>ddl-script</code> elements into extra-ddl.xml to create the views.
    Each entry should allow for re-creating the view so generally includes
    <code>drop view if exits</code> and <code>create view</code> statements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each entry becomes a "repeatable" migration and will run whenever the hash of its content changes and
    run AFTER all the normal "version" migrations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that it would be considered best practice to create a view in it's own
    <code>ddl-script</code> or include dependent views in their own <code>ddl-script</code>
    (views that are [dropped] and created together).
  </p>
  <h4>Examples:</h4>

  <pre content="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<extra-ddl xmlns="http://ebean-orm.github.io/xml/ns/extraddl">

  <ddl-script name="1 product view">
     drop view if exists product_vw cascade;

     create view product_vw as
      ...;
  </ddl-script>

  <ddl-script name="2 promotion views">
    -- 2 related/dependent views that drop and create together

    drop view if exists promotion_minprice_vw cascade;
    drop view if exists promotion_vw cascade;

    create view promotion_vw as
      ...;

    create view promotion_minprice_vw as
      ...;
  </ddl-script>

</extra-ddl>
  </pre>

  <h2 id="procedures">Stored procedures and Triggers</h2>
  <p>
    For stored procedures and triggers add a <code>ddl-script</code> for
    the related objects. Note that to support multiple databases we commonly
    specify the <code>platforms</code> attribute.
  </p>
  <h4>Examples:</h4>

  <pre content="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<extra-ddl xmlns="http://ebean-orm.github.io/xml/ns/extraddl">

  <ddl-script name="3 store price trigger" platforms="postgres">
    create or replace function trigger_store_price_log() returns trigger as $$
    begin
      ...;
    end;
    $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

    create trigger trg_store_price_log
      before update on store_price
      for each row execute procedure trigger_store_price_log();
  </ddl-script>

</extra-ddl>
  </pre>

  <h2 id="any">Any DDL </h2>
  <p>
    Note that there is not a restriction on the DDL we can put into <code>extra-ddl.xml</code>.
    We use extra-dll for DDL that isn't modelled and generated by annotations. For example,
    we generally don't expect to use extra-ddl for <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statements as
    that DDL is generated from the mapping annotations <code>@Table</code> etc.
  </p>

  <h2 id="platforms">Platform specific DDL</h2>
  <p>
    To support multiple database platforms we specify via the <code>platforms</code> attribute
    which database platforms the DDL applies to.
  </p>
  <p>
    We can use the same script <code>name</code> with different <code>platforms</code> to
    handle database specific syntax for views, stored procedures etc.
  </p>
  <h4>Examples:</h4>
  <pre content="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<extra-ddl xmlns="http://ebean-orm.github.io/xml/ns/extraddl">

  <ddl-script name="5 order agg view" platforms="h2">
    -- h2 specific DDL
    drop view order_agg_vw;
    create view order_agg_vw as
    ...;
  </ddl-script>

  <ddl-script name="5 order agg view" platforms="postgres,mysql,db2">
    -- DLL for postgres, mysql and db2
    create or replace view order_agg_vw as
    ...
  </ddl-script>

</extra-ddl>

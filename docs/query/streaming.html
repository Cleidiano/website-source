<h2 id="streaming">Streaming queries</h2>
<p>
  The following <a href="#findEach">findEach</a>, <a href="#findIterate">findIterate</a>,
  and <a href="#findStream">findStream</a> are all streaming queries with mainly a
  difference in terms of style using a closure, iterator or stream.
  With these streaming queries we can process very large results without having to hold
  all results in memory.
  <em>findEach</em> would be the recommended style as it ensures all the resources
  held by the query are closed without necessitating a try with resources block. Using
  <em>findStream</em> and <em>findIterate</em> are equally fine with the note that we
  need to ensure the QueryIterator and Stream are closed typically via <code>try with resources</code>.
</p>
<p>
  From Ebean version 12.3.5 these streaming queries use an "adaptive persistence context".
  This means that <a href="#findEach">findEach</a>, <a href="#findIterate">findIterate</a>,
  and <a href="#findStream">findStream</a> will work equally as well against small query
  results as <a href="findList">findList</a>. After 1000 beans are processed the queries adapt
  the persistence context they use to ensure it does not hold all the beans (and run out of memory
  when processing very large results).
</p>
<p>
  Queries processing less than 1000 beans use a single normal persistence context. After 1000
  beans the persistence context adapts such that it does not hold all the beans.
</p>

<h2 id="findEach">findEach</h2>
<p>
  Execute the query processing the result one bean at a time.
</p>
<pre content="java">
new QCustomer()
 .status.equalTo(Status.NEW)
 .order().id.asc()
 .findEach((Customer customer) -> {

   // do something with customer
   System.out.println("-- visit " + customer);
 });
</pre>

<h2 id="findEachWhile">findEachWhile</h2>
<p>
  Like <em>findEach</em> but takes a predicate that allows us to stop processing
  the result early.
</p>
<pre content="java">
// Returning false inside the predicate will stop the execution
new QCustomer()
   .status.equalTo(Status.NEW)
   .order().id.asc()
   .findEachWhile((Customer customer) -> {
     // do something with customer
     ...
     // return true to continue processing or false to stop
     return (customer.getId() < 40);
   });
</pre>

<h2 id="findEach-batch">findEach with batch consumer</h2>
<p>
  Similar to <em>findEach</em> but batches the beans up so that they can
  be processed in batches - for example process in batches of 100 at a time.
</p>
<pre content="java">
new QCustomer()
 .status.equalTo(Status.NEW)
 .order().id.asc()
 .findEach(100, batch -> {
   // process the customers in batches of 100 at a time
   // where batch is List<|Customer>
   ...
 });
</pre>

<h2 id="findStream">findStream</h2>
<p>
  Execute the query processing the result as a stream.
  Use a <code>try with resources</code> block to ensure the resources held by the stream are closed.
</p>

<pre content="java">
try (Stream<|Customer> stream =
  new QCustomer()
   .status.equalTo(Status.NEW)
   .order().id.asc()
   .findStream()) {

  stream
    .filter(...)
    .map(..)
    .collect(...);
}
</pre>

<h2 id="findIterate">findIterate</h2>
<p>
  Execute the query processing the result as a QueryIterator.
  Use a <code>try with resources</code> block to ensure the resources held by the iterator are closed.
</p>

<pre content="java">
try (QueryIterator<|Customer> it =
  new QCustomer()
   .status.equalTo(Status.NEW)
   .order().id.asc()
   .findIterate()) {

   while (it.hasNext()) {
     Customer customer = it.next();
     ...
   }
}
</pre>

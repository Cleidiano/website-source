<h2 id="fetch">Fetch</h2>
<p>
  With fetch we specify the properties that should be fetched on associated beans. Beans that
  are related by <em>OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToOne and ManyToMany</em>.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Fetch</em> means we want the query to eagerly load that path and that we <em>prefer</em>
  for that to happen as a <em>SQL JOIN</em>.
</p>

<pre content="java">
QCustomer cust = QCustomer.alias();
QContact cont = QContact.alias();

List<|Customer> customers =
  new QCustomer()
  .select(cust.name, cust.version, cust.whenCreated)    // root level properties
  .contacts.fetch(cont.email)                           // contacts is a OneToMany path

  .name.istartsWith("Rob")
  .findList();
</pre>
<p>
  The resulting sql is:
</p>
<pre content="sql">
select t0.id, t0.name, t0.version, t0.when_created,    -- customer columns
       t1.id, t1.email                                 -- contact columns
from customer t0
left join contact t1 on t1.customer_id = t0.id
where lower(t0.name) like ? escape'|' order by t0.id
</pre>
<p>
  The <em>contacts</em> path is a <em>OneToMany</em> so we get a <em>left join</em> to the
  contact table. We only fetch the id and email properties for the contacts.
</p>
<p>
  The above query written using the query expression API is:
</p>
<pre content="java">
List<|Customer> customers =
  database.find(Customer.class)
    .select("name, version, whenCreated")    // root level properties
    .fetch("contacts", "email")              // contacts is a OneToMany path

    .where()
    .istartsWith("name", "Rob")
    .findList();
</pre>

<h2 id="fetchVariations" class="art">Fetch variations - fetch, fetchQuery, fetchCache, fetchLazy</h2>
<p>
  There are 4 variations of fetch. The summary of what they are is:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>fetch - fetch eagerly preferring SQL JOIN</li>
  <li>fetchQuery - fetch eagerly using a separate secondary SQL query</li>
  <li>fetchCache - fetch eagerly hitting the L2 cache, cache misses fetched using a separate secondary SQL query</li>
  <li>fetchLazy - fetch lazy</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Ebean applies <a href="#rules">rules</a> when translating ORM queries to SQL queries such that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ebean will not generate a SQL cartesian product</li>
  <li>Ebean will honor maxRows in SQL</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Ebean will automatically convert <em>fetch</em> paths into <em>fetchQuery</em> paths to ensure that it
  honors these rules. In effect there is a limit on the number of OneToMany & ManyToMany paths that can
  be included in a SQL query (as otherwise we get a SQL cartesian product which is not desirable).
</p>

<h2 id="fetchQuery" class="art">FetchQuery</h2>
<p>
  When we specify <em>fetchQuery</em> we are telling Ebean that we want this path fetched eagerly but that
  we want that to be done using a separate sql query (known as a "secondary query" or "query join").
</p>
<p>
  We choose to do this on specific paths because we know the relative costs of sql joins vs query joins
  based on cardinality and the relative width of the results etc.
</p>
<pre content="java">
List<|Order> orders =
  new QOrder()
    .customer.fetchQuery()                // fetch customer (and children) using a "secondary query"
    .customer.billingAddress.fetch()
    .customer.shippingAddress.fetch()
    .findList();

</pre>
<p>
  With the above query we use <code>fetchQuery</code> to explicitly fetch the customers with their billing and
  shipping addresses using a second separate sql query.
</p>
<h5>Primary query</h5>
<pre content="sql">
-- "primary" query fetches the orders only
select t0.id, ...
from orders t0
</pre>

<h5>Secondary query (aka "query join")</h5>

<pre content="sql">
-- "secondary" query fetches customers with
-- their billing and shipping addresses

select t0.id, t0.inactive, t0.name, ...,                         -- customer
       t1.id, t1.line1, t1.line2, t1.city, ...,                  -- customers billing address
       t2.id, t2.line1, t2.line2, t2.city, ...                   -- customers shipping address
from customer t0
join address t1 on t1.id = t0.billing_address_id
join address t2 on t2.id = t0.shipping_address_id
where t0.id in (?, ?, ... )                                      -- customer ids
</pre>

<h2 id="fetchCache" class="art">FetchCache</h2>
<p>
  <em>fetchCache</em> is like fetchQuery except we hit the L2 cache first.
</p>
<pre content="java">
List<|Order> orders =
  new QOrder()
    .customer.fetchCache()         // Hit L2 cache for customer, for cache miss load from database
    .findList();
</pre>
<p>
  In the above the query fetches orders from the database. For Customer it will hit the L2 cache
  for customer and for the cache misses it will load the Customers from the Database. This is performed
  in batches of 100 customers at a time.
</p>


<h2 id="fetchLazy" class="art">FetchLazy</h2>
<p>
  With <em>fetchLazy</em> we don't want to eagerly fetch this path BUT if it is lazy loaded we are optimising
  what the lazy loading query will fetch.
</p>

<h5>e.g. lazy loading Customer only fetch the name.</h5>
```java
List<|Order> orders =
  new QOrder()
    .fetchLazy("customer", "name")
    .findList();

...

// invoke lazy loading will only fetch customer name
customer.getName();

```

<h5>e.g. lazy loading Customer additionally fetch the billingAddress and shippingAddress.</h5>
```java

QCustomer cust = QCustomer.alias();

List<|Order> orders =
  new QOrder()
    .fetchLazy("customer")
    .fetch("customer.billingAddress")  // fetched with lazy load of customer
    .fetch("customer.shippingAddress") // fetched with lazy load of customer

    .findList();


...

// invoke lazy loading will fetch customer name + billingAddress + shippingAddress
customer.getName();

```



<h2 id="querybean" class="art">Alias Query beans</h2>
<p>
  When using query beans we use <code>alias</code> beans to provide properties for both
  the <em>select</em> and <em>fetch</em>.
</p>

```java
// "alias" beans for customer and contact which
// we use to specify the properties to select and fetch
QCustomer cust = QCustomer.alias();
QContact con = QContact.alias();

// using query beans
List<|Customer> customers =
  new QCustomer()
  .select(cust.name, cust.version, cust.whenCreated)    // customer properties only
  .contacts.fetch(con.email)                            // contact properties only

  .name.istartsWith("Rob")
  .findList();
```


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Kotlin alias query beans</h3>
<p>
  For Kotlin the <em>alias</em> beans are a companion object of the query bean
  and accessed via <code>_alias</code>. Otherwise the queries are the same in Kotlin.
</p>
```kotlin
val cust = QCustomer._alias
val con = QContact._alias
```


<h2 id="tuning" class="art">Select + Fetch = projection query tuning</h2>
<p>
  Using <em>select</em> and <em>fetch</em> we are effectively tuning the query
  controlling what part of the object graph is loaded.
</p>
<p>
  Generally we prefer a query to only load what it needs to from the database. This gives us
  the ability to reduce the cost of the query, the amount of data fetched and pulled over
  the network as well as the opportunity to use covering indexes etc.
</p>

<h4>select -> "<em>graph root</em> level properties"</h4>
<p>
  The <em>select</em> defines what to fetch at the <em>root level of the object graph</em>.
</p>

<h4>fetch -> "<em>graph leaf</em> properties"</h4>
<p>
  The <em>fetch</em> defines what to fetch for the <em>leaves of the object graph</em>. This
  translates to <em>what to fetch on the OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToOne and ManyToMany paths</em>
  of the object graph.
</p>
<p>
  Note that <a href="fetchgroup">FetchGroup</a> provides an alternative to <em>select + fetch</em>.
</p>


<h2 id="rules" class="art">ORM query to SQL query rules</h2>
<p>
  Ebean enforces 2 rules when it converts an ORM query into SQL queries. These rules have the effect of
  limiting the number of sql joins that it will allow when translating an ORM query into SQL queries.
  These 2 rules are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ebean will not generate a SQL cartesian product</li>
  <li>Ebean will honor maxRows in SQL</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rule 1: No SQL Cartesian product</h3>
<p>
  This rule has the implication that Ebean will allow at most 1 join to a <code>OneToMany</code> path
  or a <code>ManyToMany</code> path. If the ORM query has more than 1 of those paths then the ORM query will
  be translated and executed as multiple SQL queries.
</p>
<p>
  We avoid sql cartesian product because it has a high risk of producing a very very bad sql query.
</p>

<h3>Rule 2: Always honor maxRows in SQL</h3>
<p>
  This rule has the implication that Ebean can not include any joins to a <code>OneToMany</code> path
  or a <code>ManyToMany</code> path if there is a <code>maxRows</code>. This is because SQL max rows
  works on rows so we can't include SQL joins to paths that have a cardinality of more than 1.
</p>
<p>
  Honoring maxRows is SQL is important because the database can typically give us a much better
  query plan and more efficient sql queries.
</p>
<p>
  Ebean detects which paths are "ToMany" paths and determines if it needs to convert any of them
  from <em>fetch</em> paths to <em>fetchQuery</em> paths. Ebean firstly takes into account
  <code>@FetchPreference</code> mapping and then the order in which the paths are specified in the query.
  That is, generally the first ToMany path stays as <em>fetch</em> and the other ToMany paths are converted
  to <em>fetchQuery</em>.

<h2>findVersions</h2>
<p>
  Return versions of a @History entity bean.
</p>
<p>
  Note that this query will work against view based history implementations
  but not sql2011 standards based implementations and we should use
  <a href="#between">findVersionsBetween</a> that requires
  a start and end timestamp to be specified.
</p>
<p>
  Generally this query is expected to be a find by id or unique predicates query.
  It will execute the query against the history returning the versions of the bean.
</p>

<h2 id="between">findVersionsBetween</h2>
<p>
  Return versions of a @History entity bean between the 2 timestamps.
</p>
<p>
  Generally this query is expected to be a find by id or unique predicates query.
  It will execute the query against the history returning the versions of the bean
  between the start and end timestamps.

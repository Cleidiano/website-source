<h2>findIterate</h2>
<p>
  Execute the query iterating over the results. This is good for processing large results where we
  want to avoid holding all the beans/results in memory but instead iterator through them.
</p>
 <p>
   Note that <code>findIterate</code> (and <a href='findEach'>findEach</a> and
   <a href='findEachWhile'>findEachWhile</a>) uses a "per graph"
   persistence context scope and adjusts <code>jdbc</code> fetch buffer size for large
   queries. As such it is better to use <a href='findList'>findList</a> for small queries.
 </p>
 <p>
   Remember that with <a href='/apidoc/current/io/ebean/QueryIterator.html'>QueryIterator</a> you must call <code>close()</code>
   when you have finished iterating the results (typically in a finally block).
 </p>
 <p>
   <a href='findEach'>findEach()</a> and <a href='findEachWhile'>findEachWhile()</a> are preferred to <code>findIterate</code> as they ensure
   the <code>jdbc</code> statement and <code>resultSet</code> are closed at the end of the iteration.
 </p>
 <p>
   This query will execute against the <code>Database</code> that was used to create it.
 </p>

<h3>Closing Resources</h3>

<b>As stated before, we must ensure the iterator is closed</b> as it holds <code>JDBC</code> resources.

We should use <code>try-with-resources</code> or a <code>try-finally</code> block to make sure that the
<a href='/apidoc/11/io/ebean/QueryIterator.html'>QueryIterator</a> is closed regardless of exceptions thrown during processing.

Note that <a href='findEach'>findEach</a> and <a href='findEachWhile'>findEachWhile</a> ensure all resources are closed
regardless and for this reason they are recommended over <code>findIterate</code>.

There are some use cases where <a href='findEach'>findEach</a> and <a href='findEachWhile'>findEachWhile</a> don't naturally
fit and that is when we would look to use <code>findIterate</code>.

<h3> Example Code </h3>

Example with <code>try-finally</code>
 ```java

Query<|Customer> query = database.find(Customer.class)
   .where().eq("status", Status.NEW)
   .order().asc("id");

QueryIterator<|Customer> it = query.findIterate();
try {
  while (it.hasNext()) {
    Customer customer = it.next();
    // do something with customer ...
  }
} finally {
  // close the underlying resources
  it.close();
}

 ```

Example with <code>try-with-resources</code>
 ```java
try (QueryIterator<|Customer> it = query.findIterate()) {
   while (it.hasNext()) {
     Customer customer = it.next();
     customer.getName();
     count.incrementAndGet();
   }
}
```

<h2 id="where">Where</h2>
<p>
  Query bean properties provide a nice type safe way to add expressions to the <code>where</code> clause.
  We get compile time validation of the query paths, expressions and bind value types.
</p>
```java
// using query bean
Customer rob =
  new QCustomer()
    .name.equalTo("Rob") // type safe expression with IDE auto-completion
    .findOne();
```
<p>
  The same query can be written without using query beans as:
</p>
```java
// using standard query
Customer rob = DB.find(Customer.class)
    .where().eq("name", "Rob")
    .findOne();
```
<p>
  Both queries above produce the same sql:
</p>
```sql
select ...
from customer t0
where t0.name = ?
```
<p>
  With the above the <code>name</code> property is of type String/varchar and so only valid String expressions
  such as <em>like, startsWith, contains</em> etc are allowed and the bind value for the expression must be a String.
</p>
<p>
  Developers get IDE assistance/auto-completion when creating queries using query beans as the properties and
  expressions available based on their types are suggested by the IDE with auto-complete.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally with query beans, if the property is renamed (e.g. "name" became "fullName") or if the property
  changed it's type then the query would no longer compile.
</p>


<h4>Paths</h4>
<p>
  With properties that are associated to beans (OneToOne, OneToMany, ManyToOne, ManyToMany)
  we can 'navigate' these paths adding valid expressions.
</p>

<h5>e.g. path "billingAddress.city" for Customer</h5>
```java
// using query beans
List<|Customer> customers =
  new QCustomer()
    .billingAddress.city.equalTo("Auckland")
    .findList();
```

```java
// using standard query
List<|Customer> customers = DB.find(Customer.class)
  .where()
     .eq("billingAddress.city", "Auckland")
  .findList();
```
<p>
  Ebean will automatically add appropriate SQL JOINS to support the expressions in the query.
</p>
```sql
select ...
from customer t0
join address t1 on t1.id = t0.billing_address_id
where t1.city = ?
```
<p>
  These property paths can be any depth. In the example below the path takes us from the
  Order bean to the Customer bean to the Address bean via <em>customer.billingAddress</em>.
</p>
<h5>e.g. path "customer.billingAddress.city" for Order</h5>
```java
List<Order> orders =
  new QOrder()
    .customer.billingAddress.city.equalTo("Auckland")
    .findList();
```


<h2 id="and" class="art">AND</h2>
<p>
  By default multiple expressions are added via <code>AND</code>.
</p>
```java
List<|Customer> customers =
  new QCustomer()
    .status.equalTo(Status.NEW)
    .whenCreated.greaterThan(lastWeek)
    .findList();
```
```sql
select ...
from customer t0
where t0.status = ? and t0.when_created > ?
```
```java
// using standard query
List<|Customer> customers = DB.find(Customer.class)
  .where()
    .eq("status", Status.NEW)
    .gt("whenCreated", lastWeek)
    .findList();
```

<h5>e.g. multiple paths for Order</h5>
```java
List<|Order> orders =
  new QOrder()
    .orderDate.greaterThan(lastWeek)
    .customer.status.equalTo(Status.NEW)
    .customer.billingAddress.city.equalTo("Auckland")
    .findList();
```
<p>
  With the above query we have the additional paths of <em>customer</em> and <em>customer.billingAddress</em>.
  Ebean will determine the joins that are needed to support the expressions.
</p>
```sql
select ...
from orders t0
join customer t1 on t1.id = t0.order_id
join address t2 on t2.id = t1.billing_address_id
where t0.order_date >= ? and t1.status = ? and t2.city = ?
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Notes on join type</h5>
<p>
  The type of join used (<code>left join</code> or <code>join</code>) is based on the cardinality and
  optionality of the relationship. For example, if the customer foreign key on order was nullable then
  that is an optional relationship and a <em>left join</em> is used.
</p>
<p>
  For any path, if a "higher level" join is a <em>left join</em> then all "child joins" (for that path) must also
  be a <em>left join</em> (i.e. "left joins cascade").  For example, in the example above - if the join from order
  to customers is a left join then the join from customer to address must also be a left join.
</p>
<p>
  The type of join to use for expression on a <em>ToMany</em> path depends on whether the expression
  is contained in a <em>OR</em>. If the expression is contained inside an <em>OR</em> then a <em>left join</em>
  is used.
</p>

<h2 id="or" class="art">OR</h2>
<p>
  When we want to add multiple expressions via <em>OR</em> we use <code>or()</code> and <code>endOr()</code>
  and all the expressions between them are joined by <em>OR</em>.
</p>
<p>
  For example: (name is null OR name = 'Rob')
</p>
```java
 Customer customer
   = new QCustomer()
      .or()
        .name.isNull()
        .name.equalTo("Rob")
      .endOr()
      .findOne()
```
```sql
select ...
from customer t0
where (t0.name is null or t0.name = ? )
```
```java
 Customer customer = DB.find(Customer.class)
    .where()
      .or()
        .isNull("name")
        .eq("name", "Rob")
      .endOr()
      .findOne()
```
<h5>OR using raw expression</h5>
<p>
  Rather than using the fluid style with <em>or()</em> and <em>endOr()</em> we can alternatively
  use <code>raw()</code> expressions. For example:
</p>
```java
 Customer customer
   = new QCustomer()
      .raw("(name is null or name = ?)", "Rob")
      .findOne()
```


<h2 id="raw" class="art">Raw expressions</h2>
<p>
  Sometimes we want to add raw expressions to the where clause.
  We use <code>raw()</code> to include arbitrary SQL, functions and stored procedures
  into the query <em>where clause</em>.
</p>

<h5>e.g. simple raw expression</h5>
```java
List<|Order> orders =
  new QOrder()
  .raw("orderDate > shipDate ")
  .findList()
```

<h5>e.g. use sql function</h5>
```java
List<|Order> orders =
  new QOrder()
  .raw("add_days(orderDate, 10) < ?", someDate)
  .findList();
```


<h5>e.g. sql subquery</h5>
```java
List<|Order> orders =
  new QOrder()
   .status.equalTo(Status.NEW)
   .raw("t0.customer_id in (select customer_id from customer_group where group_id = any(?::uuid[]))", groupIds)
   .findList()
```
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Property paths to sql joins</h4>
<p>
  If we use property paths in raw() then Ebean will automatically add appropriate joins to support the expression.
  For example:
</p>
```java
List<|Order> orders =
    new QOrder()
      .raw("(customer.name = ? or customer.billingAddress.city = ?)", "Rob", "Auckland")
      .findList();
```
<p>
  ... produces the following SQL with joins added to the customer and address tables.
</p>
```sql
  select t0.id, t0.status, t0.order_date, t0.ship_date, ...
  from orders t0
  left join customer t1 on t1.id = t0.customer_id            -- supports customer.name
  left join address t2 on t2.id = t1.billing_address_id      -- supports customer.billingAddress.city
  where (t1.name = ? or t2.city = ?); --bind(Rob,Auckland)
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Combing expressions</h4>
<p>
  We can combine <em>raw()</em> expressions with other expressions. For example:
</p>
```java
  List<|Order> orders =
    new QOrder()
      .status.eq(Order.Status.NEW)       // before raw()
      .raw("(customer.name = ? or customer.billingAddress.city = ?)", "Rob", "Auckland")
      .orderDate.greaterThan(lastWeek)   // after raw()
      .findList();
```
```sql
select ...
where t0.status = ?  and (t1.name = ? or t2.city = ?) and t0.order_date > ?
 --bind(NEW,Rob,Auckland,2019-01-17)
```


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Ode to Raw expressions</h4>
<p>
  If developer life was simple we would not need raw expressions. Many real world projects often have
  a few queries where our nice ORM query gets us 90% there but there is that predicate needed that is
  best expressed in SQL or uses a database specific function or feature.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Raw expressions</em> is this nice little feature that allows us to put that arbitrary SQL
  expression into the where clause.  We could instead go to findNative etc and provide all the SQL
  for the query but that is a bigger jump and raw expressions gives us that flexibility.
</p>
<p>
  I'm not sure if I'm allowed a <em>favourite feature</em> but if I was I'd vote for raw expressions.
